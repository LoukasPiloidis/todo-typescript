# To-Do app on steroids
  Created as a requirement for a job application, this ToDo app allows users to:
  1. Create main ToDo items and add them to the list.
  2. Create sub-items for every main item and append them to the appropriate place.
  3. Users can collaborate on the same list from different machines.
  4. Crossing out all list elements, the main item is automatically crossed out.
  5. Different interface and input data based on which radio menu a user clicks.
